# LlamaDoom

## Introduction
Ever since seeing Doom for the first time in '93-94, I've loved it. Ever since getting my first Commodore 64, I've loved programming. A couple of decades later and I've been a Software Engineer and still work in technologly sector.

I've been looking for a personal project to keep me entertained and to do some programming outwith my usual day-to-day activities.

So, I've decided to combine my 2 loves and attempt to port Doom to .NET. Yes this has been done before and yes Doom has been ported to almost everything but this is about the adventure and learning experience in doing this myself and seeing where I end up.

Will I complete the port? Who knows! All I will commit too is documenting this adventure as I go. I don't expect this to blow the world away. I just want to see if I can understand my favourite game of all time in a better way and have a good time doing so.
